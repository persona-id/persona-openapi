    Consolidates several source Accounts' information into one target Account.
    Any Persona resource associated with the source Account will be transferred
    over to the destination Account. However, the Account's attributes will
    **not** be transferred. After consolidation, you can update the destination
    Account's attributes using the [Account update
    endpoint](https://docs.withpersona.com/api-reference/accounts/update-an-account).


    This endpoint can be used to clean up duplicate Accounts.


    Note: A source account can only be consolidated once. Afterwards, the source
    account will be archived.
