        Permanently deletes personally identifiable information (PII) for an Account and all associated Inquiries, Verifications and Reports. The response indicates a successful redaction of the Account. Redaction of the Account's associated child objects is done asynchronously and may take  some time before all associated child objects are fully redacted. **This action cannot be undone**.

        This endpoint can be used to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR / CCPA or to enforce data privacy.

        Note: An account is still updatable after redaction. If you want to delete data continuously, please reach out to us to help you setup a retention policy.

        Consolidates several source Accounts' information into one target Account. Any Persona resource associated with the source Account will be transferred over to the destination Account. However, the Account's attributes will **not** be transferred. After consolidation, you can update the destination Account's attributes using the [Account update endpoint](https://docs.withpersona.com/api-reference/accounts/update-an-account).

        This endpoint can be used to clean up duplicate Accounts.

        Note: A source account can only be consolidated once. Afterwards, the source account will be archived and unable to be used moving forward - any attempts to create an inquiry attached to the source account will fail.

        Search for accounts using a flexible query language.

        ## Search vs. List Endpoints

        The Search and List endpoints serve different purposes and have distinct performance characteristics.

        Use the **Search** endpoint (`POST /accounts/search`) when you need to perform complex queries with boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT), filter by custom fields or identifiers, or apply multiple conditions simultaneously. Search is optimized for flexible querying and is faster than paginating through all resources when looking for specific records.

        Use the **List** endpoint (`GET /accounts`) for simple listing with basic filters like reference ID.

        ## Data Freshness

        Do not use search for read-after-write flows because the data will not be immediately available to search.
        Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable within approximately 1 minute of creation or modification.
        Propagation of new or updated data could be delayed during an outage.
        For workflows that require immediate data availability after creating or updating an account, use the List Accounts endpoint instead.

        ### Searchable Attributes

        The following attributes can be used in query predicates:

        | Attribute | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | `type` | Account type (e.g., `acttp_ABC123`) |
        | `status` | Account status (e.g., `actst_ABC123`) |
        | `created_at` | Account creation timestamp |
        | `updated_at` | Account last updated timestamp |
        | `identifiers.*` | Custom identifier (e.g., `identifiers.user_id`) |
        | `fields.*` | Custom account field (e.g., `fields.age`) |

        **Note:** Custom fields (`fields.*`) must be configured as searchable on the Account Type to be queryable.

        Search for cases using a flexible query language.

        ## Search vs. List Endpoints

        The Search and List endpoints serve different purposes and have distinct performance characteristics.

        Use the **Search** endpoint (`POST /cases/search`) when you need to perform complex queries with boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT), filter by custom fields, assignee, case queue, or SLA expiration, or apply multiple conditions simultaneously. Search is optimized for flexible querying and is faster than paginating through all resources when looking for specific records.

        Use the **List** endpoint (`GET /cases`) for simple listing with basic filters like status, case template, account, inquiry, or report.

        ## Data Freshness

        Do not use search for read-after-write flows because the data will not be immediately available to search.
        Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable within approximately 1 minute of creation or modification.
        Propagation of new or updated data could be delayed during an outage.
        For workflows that require immediate data availability after creating or updating a case, use the List Cases endpoint instead.

        ### Searchable Attributes

        The following attributes can be used in query predicates:

        | Attribute | Description |
        |-----------|-------------|
        | `template` | Case template (e.g., `ctmpl_ABC123`) |
        | `status` | Case status (e.g., `open`, `pending`, `resolved`) |
        | `state` | Case state |
        | `created_at` | Case creation timestamp |
        | `updated_at` | Case last updated timestamp |
        | `resolved_at` | Case resolution timestamp |
        | `sla_expires_at` | SLA expiration timestamp |
        | `assignee` | Assigned user (e.g., `user_ABC123`) |
        | `case_queue` | Case queue (e.g., `cqueue_ABC123`) |
        | `resolver` | Resolver user |
        | `fields.*` | Custom case field (e.g., `fields.priority`) |

        **Note:** Custom fields (`fields.*`) must be configured as searchable on the Case Template to be queryable.

        Note that if you use webhooks, updates to inquiries that are not in progress can result in data getting out of sync. For example, updating a completed Inquiry will not cause your Inquiry completed webhook to retrigger.

        Inquiries represent a snapshot of data collected from an individual, so we generally do not recommend updating an Inquiry's data after the Inquiry has been finalized.
